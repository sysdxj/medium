# How to Train Your Brain to Remember Almost Anything(如何训练你的大脑记忆几乎所有的东西)

## How to better prepare yourself for acquiring — and retaining — new knowledge(如何让自己准备好获取并且记住新的知识)

Success is largely based on *what* you know — everything you know informs the choices you make. And those choices are either getting you closer to what you want or increasing the distance between you and your ultimate goal in life.

成功很大程度上取决于你的知识-你知道的所有东西告知了你要做的选择。而且这些选择要么使你离自己的目标更近要么让你和自己的最终目标距离越来越远

Many people want to learn better, faster, retain more information, and apply that knowledge at the right time.

很多人想学习的更好，更快，记住更多的信息，而且在适当的时间应用这些知识。

But the reality is that we forget a lot of what we learn. Human forgetting follows a pattern. In fact, research [shows](https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/curve-forgetting) that within just one hour, if nothing is done with new information, most people will have forgotten about 50% of what they learned. After 24 hours, this will be 70%, and if a week passes without that information being used, up to 90% of it could be lost.

但是事实是我们会忘记很多我们学习的东西。人类的忘性都有一个特征。事实上，研究表明如果一个小时内，没有对新知识做什么的话，大多数人都会忘记50%学习到的东西。24小时后，会达到70%，如果这些信息一个星期没有使用，高达90%会忘记。

To improve your acquisition of knowledge — and retention, new knowledge must be consolidated and securely stored in long-term memory. You have to actively do something with new information to make it worth your while.

为了促进知识的获取-和留存，新知识必须被巩固和安全的存放在长期记忆里。你必须主动用使用新知识让它值得你的努力。

According to Elizabeth Bjork, who worked on a [*theory of forgetting*](https://www.wired.com/2008/04/ff-wozniak/) along with Piotr Wozniak, long-term memory can be characterized by two components — retrieval strength and storage strength. Retrieval strength measures how likely you are to recall something right now, how close it is to the surface of your mind. Storage strength measures how deeply the memory is rooted.

根据Elizabeth Bjork的说法 ，（他和Piotr Wozniak一起研究忘记的相关理论），长期记忆有两部分特性，提取能力和储存能力。提取能力衡量了现在你能回想起某事的几率，以及距离你头脑表面有多近。储存能力衡量了记忆存储的有多深。

If we want our learning to stick, we have to be doing more than just aim to read a book every week, or passively listen to an audiobook or podcast.

如果我们想让学习的知识持久，我们必须比每周读一本书或者听一个有声书这样的目标做的多。

Research indicates that when memory is first recorded in the brain (specifically in the hippocampus) it’s still “fragile” and easily forgotten.

研究表明当记忆第一次记录在大脑中（尤其是海马体），它仍然是脆弱和易忘记的。

## How you process information determines how much you’ll remember later（你处理信息的方式决定了稍后你还会记得多少）

Our brains are constantly recording information on a temporary basis — scraps of conversations you hear on your way to work, things you see, and what the person in front of you was wearing, etc. It’s the only way to separate the relevant knowledge from the clutter.

我们的大脑在临时记忆的基础上不断的存储信息-上班路上听到的对话碎片，看到的东西，你前面人的穿着等等。这是从混乱中分离相关信息的唯一方法。

The brain dumps everything that doesn’t come up again in the recent future as soon as possible to make way for new information — if you want to use it again, you have to deliberately work on storing it in your long-term memory.

大脑为了给新的信息腾出空间，会尽快丢掉最近不再出现的任何东西-如果你想再次使用它，你必须有意让它存储在长期记忆里。

This process is called *encoding* — imprinting information into the brain. Without proper encoding, there is nothing to store and attempting to retrieve the memory later will fail. Reprocessing things you read and learn daily send a big signal to your brain to hold onto that knowledge.

这个过程叫做编码-在大脑中刻上印记。没有合适的编码，就无法存储东西，随后提取记忆也会失败。对每天读到和学到的东西进行再处理会给你的大脑发送一个很大的信号让大脑保存那份知识。

In the late 19th century, Herman Ebbinghaus (a psychologist) was the first to systematically tackle the analysis of memory.

在19世纪晚期，Herman Ebbinghaust(一个心理学家)是第一个系统对记忆进行分析研究的人。

His [*Forgetting Curve*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) which hypothesises the decline of memory retention in time was influential to the field of memory science back then when he was studying how the brain stores information.

他在研究大脑存储信息时的著作《遗忘曲线》假设记忆保留随着时间而衰退，影响了那时的记忆科学领域的研究。

He once said, “With any considerable number of repetitions, a suitable distribution of them over a space of time is decidedly more advantageous than the massing of them at a single time.”

他曾经说过，“伴随着很多次的重复，经过一段时间的合理分配比一次性的乱丢在一起更有优势。”

In a University of Waterloo [report](https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/curve-forgetting), the author of the *Curve of Forgetting* explains, *“*When the same thing is repeated, your brain says, “Oh — there it is again, I better keep that.” When you are exposed to the same information repeatedly, it takes less and less time to “activate” the information in your long term memory and it becomes easier for you to retrieve the information when you need it.”

在滑铁卢大学的报告中，《遗忘曲线》的作者解释道，“当相同的事情被重复，你的大脑会说，”哦-又是它，我最好保存下来。“当你重复面对相同的信息，在长期记忆里激活这些信息花费的时间越来越少，当你需要它的时候，提取它也越来越容易。

Most life-long learning will inevitably involve some reading and listening, but by using a variety of techniques to commit new knowledge to memory, you will cement new information quicker and better.

大多数终身的学习不可避免的需要阅读和倾听，但是运用一些新技术把新知识转化成记忆，你将更快更好的掌握新知识。

Leverage spaced repetition — repeating what you are trying to retain over a period of time. Example, when you read a book and really enjoy it, instead of putting it away, re-read it again after a month, then again after three months, then again after six months, and then again after a year.

利用间隔开的重复-隔一段时间重复你想掌握的知识。例如，当你读一本书并且很喜欢，一个月之后再度一遍，然后三个月之后再读，然后半年，再然后一年，而不是读完就放到一边。

Spaced repetition leverages spacing effect, a memory phenomenon that shows how our brains learn.

间隔重复利用了间隔效应，一个显示我们大脑如何学习的现象

Use the 50/50 rule. Research shows that explaining a concept to someone else is the best way to learn it yourself. The 50/50 rule is a better way to learn, process, retain and remember information is to learn half the time and share half the time.

运用50/50规则。研究表明像某人解释一个概念是最好的学习方式。50/50规则是

Learn for 50% of the time and explain what you learn for 50% of the time. Example, instead of completing a book, aim to read 50 percent and try recalling, sharing, or writing down the key ideas you have learned before proceeding. Or better still share that new knowledge with your audience.

学习占50%的时间，解释占50%。例如，替代读完一本书，目标是读50%然后回想，分享，或者将你所学到的关键点写下来然后再继续。或者最好仍然和你的观众分享新知识。

You could even apply it to the chapters instead of the whole book. The 50/50 learning method works really well if you aim to retain most of what are learning. The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to transfer it to another person.

你甚至可以将这个方法应用于每一章而不是整本书。如果你想掌握大部分你所学习的，50/50学习方法很好用。对你知识的最终测试方法是你将它传授给另一个人的能力。

“The best way to learn something truly is to teach it — not just because explaining it helps you understand it, but also because retrieving it helps you remember it,” [says](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/smarter-living/how-to-improve-your-memory-even-if-you-cant-find-your-car-keys.html) Adam Grant.

“学习知识最好的方法是传授-不仅是因为解释帮助你理解，而且检索它能帮助你记忆，”Adam Grant说

Make the most of topic demonstrations to understand the topic inside out. Unlike simply reading or listening to an explanation, demonstrations show you how something works and help you visualise the concept. In some applicable situations like learning photography, design, public speaking, negotiation, a useful new technology, etc., using instructional videos that demonstrate what you’re trying to learn can improve your retention rate.

尽量利用主题示范来深入理解主题。和简单的阅读或者听讲解不同，示例展示了事情如何生效，并且是概念更形象。在一些应用场景比如学习摄影，设计，演讲，谈判以及有用的新技术等你正在你离学习的方面使用指导的演示视频，可以提高你记忆的留存率。

Finally, use sleep as a powerful aid in-between learning sessions. Not only is sleep after learning a critical part of the memory creation process but sleep before learning is important as well.

最后，在学习阶段利用睡眠作为一个强力的援助。不仅在学习重要部分的记忆创造阶段，而且学习前的睡眠也很重要。

Short naps can help recover energy. There are now dozens of evidence that supports naps. Longer naps (60+ minutes) — where memory consolidation happens, is even better.

小憩可以帮助恢复体力。现在有很多证据支持小憩。长时间睡眠（60+分钟）记忆会巩固，甚至更好。

The more the mind is used, the more robust memory can become. Taking control of information storage will not only help you add on new bits of information but will reinforce and refine the knowledge you already have.

头脑使用的越多，记忆就越强。控制信息存储不仅仅能帮你掌握新知识而且能强化而且能提炼你已经有的知识。

Here’s a quote by Edgar Allan Poe, Marginalia to ponder as you train your brain to learn and remember better — *“If you wish to forget anything on the spot, make a note that this thing is to be remembered.”*

下面是埃德加·爱伦·坡的名言，在你训练大脑更好的学习和记忆的同时，旁注思考-“如果你想立刻忘记任何事情，请记下这件事将被记住。”
